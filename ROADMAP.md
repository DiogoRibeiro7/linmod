# linmod ‚Äì Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the ongoing development plan for `linmod`, a modular and transparent toolkit for linear modeling built with NumPy. Progress is organized by technical milestones and development areas.

### Outlier and Influence Measures
- [ ] Cook‚Äôs Distance thresholds and tagging
- [ ] DFFITS and DFBETAS statistics
- [ ] Leverage-based outlier detection
- [ ] Unified `.influence_summary()` returning DataFrame

### Residual-Aware Refitting
- [ ] `.fit_robust(trim="cook")` to exclude outliers before fitting

### Automated Diagnostics Reporting
- [ ] `.diagnostics_report()` with output formats: text, LaTeX, HTML
- [ ] Summary tables with interpretation flags (e.g., warning, significant)

### Multicollinearity Diagnostics
- [ ] Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- [ ] Condition number thresholding
- [ ] Add VIF to `.summary()` and `.diagnostics()`

### Robust Transformation Suggestions
- [ ] Better Box‚ÄìCox lambda search via log-likelihood
- [ ] Residual-feature nonlinear correlation scan
- [ ] More targeted predictor transformation recommendations

### Pipeline Comparison
- [ ] `.diagnostic_pipeline()`:
  - Fit original model
  - Suggest + apply transformations
  - Fit transformed model
  - Compare metrics and residual tests side-by-side

### Diagnostic Visualization
- [ ] Annotated diagnostic plots with influence labels
- [ ] Heatmap: residuals vs. predictor correlations

### (Optional)
- [ ] Breusch‚ÄìGodfrey test for autocorrelated residuals
- [ ] Levene and Bartlett tests for groupwise homoscedasticity

  - [ ] Durbin‚ÄìWatson test
  - [ ] Residual autocorrelation and PACF

---

## ‚è≥ Stage 7 ‚Äì Reporting and Export
